# IAT355_Final_Project


hihi, the images and the css file are in the src folder (there isn't much in the css file)
I've been using Tailwind for CSS (as the teaching team recommended), here's the link to it's docs, it's also on Discord: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

Thank You! --Liz
